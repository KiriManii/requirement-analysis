# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the complete requirement analysis documentation for a Booking Management System, as part of the ALX ProDev Frontend curriculum. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, following real-world software development practices.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a key phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the development team identifies and defines what the software must do. It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, analyzing them, and translating them into actionable documentation and diagrams.

This process ensures a shared understanding between developers, stakeholders, and users. It helps avoid miscommunication, scope creep, and rework by establishing what needs to be built before any code is written.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity and Shared Understanding**: It ensures that all stakeholders, developers, and clients are aligned on what the system should do.

2. **Prevents Scope Creep**: By defining boundaries early, it limits uncontrolled expansion of features during development.

3. **Foundation for Development and Testing**: Requirement documents act as blueprints for development and benchmarks for quality assurance.

4. **Cost and Time Efficiency**: Helps estimate project resources accurately, minimizing delays and overspending.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting stakeholder input using interviews, surveys, observations, and document analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.

- **Requirement Documentation**: Writing structured specs, user stories, and use cases.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Prioritizing requirements, checking feasibility, and creating data flow/use case diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**: Reviewing with stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy. Defining acceptance criteria and traceability.

  ## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do. For the Booking Management System:

- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts.
- **Property Search**: Search properties by location, price, and availability.
- **Booking System**: Book and manage reservations.
- **Secure Login**: Users must log in to access their dashboard.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin can add, update, or remove property listings.

### Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system should perform:

- **Performance**: Pages must load within 2 seconds for 1000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Use HTTPS, encrypt data, and protect against SQL injection.
- **Usability**: Simple UI with clear navigation and mobile responsiveness.
- **Scalability**: System should scale horizontally with traffic spikes.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated recovery after failure.
